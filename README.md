# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently. The application offers the following features:

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can easily add new tasks to their to-do list by entering the task description and clicking the "Add Task" button or pressing the 'Enter' key.

- **Remove Tasks**: Unwanted tasks can be removed from the list by selecting them and clicking the "Remove Task" button.

- **Mark as Done**: Users can mark tasks as done by selecting them and clicking the "Mark as Done" button. Completed tasks are moved to the "Completed Tasks" list.

- **Task List**: The application displays two lists: "Pending Tasks" and "Completed Tasks," making it easy to distinguish between unfinished and completed tasks.

- **Timestamp**: Each task entry includes a timestamp, indicating when the task was added or marked as done.

- **Scrollable Lists**: Both the "Pending Tasks" and "Completed Tasks" lists are scrollable, allowing users to view and manage a large number of tasks.

- **Data Persistence**: Task data is stored in a CSV file, ensuring that tasks are preserved even after closing the application.
